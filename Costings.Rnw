\chapter{Costings}
\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Technical assumptions}
The key assumptions that apply to each of the proposal costings are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The 2012-13 2\%\ sample file obtained through \textsc{taxstats} is accurate and representative of that year.
\item The \verb=grattan::income_tax= function in the grattan R package is accurate and complete for the 2012-13 financial year.
\item The 2012-13 financial year is sufficiently representative of future years.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Overview of tax expenditure sanity checking}
The tax expenditure for the capital gains tax discount (E17) is \$4,180~billion.\footcite{TaxExpenditures201213} 
<<TaxStatsCapitalGainsDiscount>>=
fread(sample_file_of(2013)) %>%
  mutate(Taxable_Income_new = Taxable_Income - Net_CG_amt + 2 * Net_CG_amt) %>% # no discount
  mutate(current_tax = income_tax(Taxable_Income),
         new_tax = income_tax(Taxable_Income_new), 
         diff = new_tax - current_tax) %$%
  round(sum(diff) * 50 / 1e9, 1) ->
  apparent_CG_tax_expenditure_201213_billions
@

This differs from the amount implicit in taxstats of \$\Sexpr{apparent_CG_tax_expenditure_201213_billions}~billion. The discrepancy may be the absence of benenfits to trusts in this statistic. 

\section{30\%\ CGT discount and negative gearing only for the non-salary component of taxable income}
Instead of a 50\%\ discount on the amount of capital gains that may be taxed, we propose a 30\%\ discount on the component of capital gains forming one's assessable income. Further, we propose that individuals be no longer permitted to deduct losses arising from their investments against any income other than investments and capital gains; in particular, negative gearing against salaries and wages will cease.
\subsection{Status quo}
Currently, assessable income ($I_A$) is encoded directly into tax stats
\[I_A = \verb=Taxable_Income=\]
An individual's capital gains amount is recorded in Income item 18 labels A (Net capital gains) and H (Total capital gains). Item A includes the 50\%\ discount and capital losses, but item H does not.\footnote{See \url{https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Tax-Return/2013/Supplementary-tax-return/Income-questions-13-24/18---Capital-gains/}} This corresponds to items \verb=Net_CG_amt= and \verb=Tot_CY_CG_amt= respectively. We thus ignore \verb=Tot_CY_CG_amt=.

Capital gains tax for individuals is not a separate tax; it is simply a component of an individual's income tax. Once the appropriate deductions and discounts have been made, it is simply added on to a person's assessable income:
\[I_A = \text{Capital gains (after discounts, deductions)} + \text{Other income}\]
and
\[\text{tax payable} = T(I_A)\]
where $T$ is not a function of capital gains, $\frac{\partial T(\cdot)}{\partial \text{Capital gain}} = 0$.
%
\subsection{Our proposal}
We need to determine:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Total capital gains (pre-discount) for each taxpayer
\item The amount they could deduct, but can no longer
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Total capital gains}
Determining total capital gains from tax stats suffers from a flaw. Only the \emph{Total capital gains} $K_T$ and the \emph{Net capital gains} $K_n$ are recorded. Net capital gains is the component of an individual's income upon which the marginal tax rate is applied -- it includes both capital losses and the capital gains discount. Total capital gains is the sum of all capital gains for the year, without capital losses or the capital gains discount.

It follows that our best estimate of the total capital gains to which the discount would apply is double the \emph{Net capital gains} amount. So the assessable income under a new regime ($I_A'$) with a discount on capital gains of $d$ will be 

\[I_A' = I_A - K_n + 2K_n(1 - d).\]

\begin{smallbox}{Tax stats}{box:TaxStatsCapitalGains}
John purchases and sells (13 months later) two houses, making capital gains of \$10,000 and \$25,000. He also experienced a capital loss of $-$\$5,000 last year which has not yet been applied against later year capital gains. His total capital gains is \$35,000 and his net capital gains is \$15,000.

In our calculations, we only see that John had a total capital gain of \$35,000 and a net capital gain of \$15,000. We infer that his total capital gains was $2\times \$15,000 = \$30,000$. 
\end{smallbox}

new_discount <- 0.30  #old is 0.50

fread(sample_file_of(2013)) %>%

    current_tax = income_tax(Taxable_Income),
    current_assessable_income = Taxable_Income,
    #proposed_non_cap_assessable_income = Taxable_Income,
    proposal_capital_tax = income_tax(Taxable_Income - Net_CG_amt + (1 - new_discount) * (2 * Net_CG_amt))

         proposal_tax_No_NG = income_tax(Taxable_Income_No_NG)
  ) %$% 
  {50*(sum(proposal_tax_No_NG) - sum(current_tax))}

\subsection{Eslake proposal: no negative gearing against salary}
Current:
\begin{align*}
I_A &= \text{Salary} + \text{Other income} \\
&\qquad{} - \text{deductions excl. rental losses} - \text{rental losses}
\end{align*}
Let:
\begin{align*}
I_S &= \text{Salary}\\
I_{A\backslash S} &= \text{Other income} \\
&\qquad{} - \text{deductions excl. rental losses} - \text{rental losses} \\
 &= I_A - I_S
\end{align*}
Then a person's assesable income under the new scenario, $I_A'$ is the person's salary where deductions are only permitted against the person's non-salary income. Deductions in excess of a person's non-salary income may not be further deducted against his salary:
\begin{align*}
I_A' &= I_S + \max\left(0, I_A - I_S \right)
\end{align*}
Note under this scenario, anyone who has a nonnegative salary \EMPH{cannot obtain a taxable loss}. Any costings using this scenario will overestimate the revenue colllectable under a scenario that violates this assumption.

\subsection{Application to taxstats}
<<Minimum_Tax_From_Salary, results = 'asis'>>=
current_tax_receipts <- 50*sum(income_tax(fread(sample_file_of(2013))$Taxable_Income))

isolate_salary_for_ng <- 
  fread(sample_file_of(2013)) %>%
  mutate(
    current_tax = income_tax(Taxable_Income),
    Taxable_Income_No_NG = Sw_amt + pmax(0, Taxable_Income - Sw_amt),
    new_tax = income_tax(Taxable_Income_No_NG),
    tax_diff = new_tax - current_tax
  ) 

isolate_salary_for_ng %$% 
  {sum(new_tax)*50} ->
  #
  tax_receipts_no_NG__Salary_isolated

isolate_salary_for_ng %>%
  select(Net_rent_amt, Taxable_Income, Taxable_Income_No_NG, current_tax, new_tax) %>%
  setnames(c("Net rental profit", "$I_A$", "$I_A'$", "Tax (status quo)", "Tax (new)")) %>% 
  summary %>% 
  xtable(caption = "Summary table for taxable income based on $I_A' = I_S + \\max(0, I_A - I_s)$.") %>%
  print(floating.environment = "table*", caption.placement = "top",
        include.rownames = FALSE, sanitize.colnames.function = function(x){x})
@
So under the current regime where \$\Sexpr{round(current_tax_receipts/1e9, 1)}~billion is payable in income tax, the above scenario renders \$\Sexpr{round(tax_receipts_no_NG__Salary_isolated/1e9, 1)}~billion payable.

\section{Henry-lite proposal}
The proposal in the Henry review is to reduce both the capital gains discount and the amount one can deduct through negative gearing. In particular, the tax review proposes the discount be reduced to 30\%\ and a discount of 30\%\ be applied to both rental losses and rental income.\footnote{The income tax treatment of these household savings would be improved by applying a
40 per cent discount to most interest income, net residential rental property income, capital
gains and certain interest expenses. Doing so would provide a more consistent tax
outcome for income from bank deposits and bonds, shares, and rental properties, and
provide a means of adjusting for the effect of inflation. \textcite{Treasury2010a}.}

Under this proposal, income tax would rise from \$\Sexpr{round(50*sum(daley_taxstats$current_tax)/1e9, 1)}~billion to \$\Sexpr{round(50*sum(daley_taxstats$new_tax)/1e9, 1)}~billion. (2012-13 taxstats) But the extra revenue due to this policy will reduce: losses brought forward (that would have otherwise been used to reduce ordinary taxable income) will be offset against capital gains. This will reduce the increased revenue for \$\Sexpr{round(sum(daley_taxstats$diff)*50/1e9,1)}~bn to \$\Sexpr{round(sum(daley_taxstats$diff_incl_carry_fwd)*50/1e9,1)}~bn.
